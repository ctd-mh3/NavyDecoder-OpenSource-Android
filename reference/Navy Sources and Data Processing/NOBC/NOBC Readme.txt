Download "Excel Version - Navy Officer Billet Classification (NOBC) Codes"
from https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/NOOCS-Manual/NOOCS-VOL-1/

Steps (Not verified to be 100% correct):
- Use customized and added "Modified" tab to create output sql
- Copy needed columns (NOBC, LONG TITLE) to "Modified"
- Look at existing rows where there is a "Yes" in "Had to Tweak" Column.  These are rows where
  the title text had to be tweaked for some reason (e.g., excel function messed up Acronym  
  capitalization) 
- Create sql statements and java code
